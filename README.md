# Minimalist Hugo Template for Academic Websites

This repository contains the source code to https://pascalmichaillat.org: a personal academic website created with [Hugo](https://github.com/gohugoio/hugo) and the [PaperMod theme](https://github.com/adityatelange/hugo-PaperMod). The website is hosted on [GitHub Pages](https://docs.github.com/en/pages/getting-started-with-github-pages/about-github-pages).

The code is publicly available as a template repository so anyone can generate a new repository with the same directory structure and files, and quickly create their own website. The code might also be helpful to anyone who wishes to learn about Hugo or wants to recreate specific features of the website.

## Documentation

The source code is documented at https://pascalmichaillat.org/d5/.

## Features

The PaperMod theme is modified in several ways to be more adapted to academic websites:

+ Webpages are organized in three categories, which are available from any page through the menu and from the homepage through buttons: 
	* Papers
	* Courses
	* Design projects
+ A list of tags (keywords) used in papers and courses is automatically generated so visitors can easily see the topics covered in research and teaching.
+ The website provides social icons specific to academia: office hours, Zoom, Substack, and Google Scholar.
+ The metadata for webpages, which appear below the webpage title, are tailored to the academic context.
+ Color scheme, font, spacing, buttons, and general appearance have been streamlined and made as minimalist as possible.
+ The website provides new archetypes for paper pages, course pages, an archive page, and a search page.

## Installation

+ Clone the repository to your local machine
+ Install [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/installation/). On a Mac, this is easily done with [Homebrew](https://brew.sh): simply run `brew install hugo` in the terminal.
+ Since the website is hosted on GitHub Pages, it is convenient to update the website through [GitHub Desktop](https://desktop.github.com).

## Usage

### Website development

To check that everything works, experiment with the code, and slowly develop your website, start by rebuilding the website locally. In the terminal, navigate to the website directory and run `hugo server` from there. The command builds the website with Hugo and starts a local web server. The website is then available at http://localhost:1313 in any web browser. Hugo automatically rebuilds the site and refreshes the webpage in the browser as changes are made to any file in the website repository. This allows you to see changes instantly as you are developing your website. 

### Website compilation

Once your website is ready to be made public, run `hugo` in the terminal from the website directory. This command will convert content files into HTML pages, handle static assets, generate URLs and organize pages, and finally compile the website into the `public` folder for deployment.

### Website deployment

With GitHub Desktop, you can  easily commit the changes and push them to the website repository on GitHub. Then, [GitHub Actions](https://gohugo.io/hosting-and-deployment/hosting-on-github/) will build the website and deploy it to GitHub Pages. The workflow is in the `hugo.yml` file stored in the `.github/workflows` folder. It usually takes a few minutes for the website to be deployed and go live.

## Customization

### Google Analytics

The website supports Google Analytics 4. But do not forget to update the Google Analytics ID in `config.yml`. 

+ Either replace the ID `G-97G4MZ4061` with your own ID in the line `googleAnalyticsID: "G-97G4MZ4061"`. 
+ Or simply comment the line `googleAnalyticsID: "G-97G4MZ4061"` if you do not wish to use Google Analytics.

### Configuration file

Beside the Google Analytics ID, make sure to update all the parameters that are specific to your website in the configuration file `config.yml`. Such parameters include:

+ `baseURL` – The website URL
+ `title` – Your name, to be used as title of the website
+ `params:author` - Your name, to be used in HTML meta tags to specify the author of the webpage's content (this only adds a meta tag to the header of the homepage, it doesn't have any direct impact on the appearance or functionality of the webpage itself)
+ `params:description` – A short description (less than 155 characters) of who you are, to be used in HTML meta tags to specify the content of the webpage (this description often appears in search engine results below the title of the webpage)
+ `params:profileMode:title` – Your name, to be used as title on the homepage
+ `params:profileMode:subtitle` – A description of who you are, to be used as a subtitle on the homepage
+ `params:profileMode:imageTitle` – Your name, to be used as tag for your profile picture
+ `params:socialIcons` – The URLs to your social accounts

### Static files

The files in the `static` folder are PDF files and images to which the website links. All the files currently in the `static` folder pertain to this website and can be safely deleted, with the exception of the following files:

+ `picture.jpeg` is the picture appearing on the homepage. Replace it with your own picture.
+ `cv.pdf` is the CV linked to the CV icon on the homepage. Replace it with your own CV.
+ `favicon.io`, `favicon-32x32.png`, `favicon-16x16.png`, and `apple-touch-icon.png` is the favicon appearing in the menu bar next to the website title, and in the browser next to the URL. Replace it with the [favicon of your choice](https://favicon.io).

### Public folder

The `public` folder contains the fully generated static website files that are ready to be deployed to GitHub Pages. When you run the `hugo` command, Hugo processes your content, templates, and other project files and generates a static website. The resulting output is placed in the `public` folder by default.

The `public` folder can therefore be  safely deleted. A new version of the `public` folder will be created when you run the `hugo` command from your own repository.

## Performance

Despite the modifications to the PaperMod theme, the website continues to perform well on mobile and desktop devices. Here is an overview of the mobile performance from [PageSpeed Insights](https://pagespeed.web.dev/):
